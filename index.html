         Dear my beloved sister,
         <br>There are only a few minutes left before the New Year begins in Canada, 
         even though I already welcomed the New Year earlier here in Korea.
         <br>In 2026, you are turning 26. Perhaps 2025 was not a very lucky year for you, 
         <br>so I sincerely hope that 2026 will bring you many positive changes, peace, and good fortune.
         <br>It’s truly a pity that I can’t celebrate the New Year with you this year. 
         <br>Still, I feel grateful knowing that you have someone special to share this meaningful moment with. 
         <br>I hope you have a warm, happy, and joyful New Year’s Eve with your husband.
         <br>I miss you so much.
         <br>From, your little sister
        </p>
